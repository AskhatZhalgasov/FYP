# Library checkpointing library
This is the prototype implementation of checkpointing library. Based on the following [project](https://github.com/ljw1004/blog/tree/master/Async/AsyncWorkflow). 

## DOC:
Run the code: 
```console
foo@bar:~$ g++-10 -fcoroutines -std=c++17 program.cpp
```

## TODO:
- [x] finished the prototype
- [ ] remove namespace std
- [ ] integrate data structure which holds the variables (**how?**)
- [ ] come up with use cases
- [ ] decouple library to header file
